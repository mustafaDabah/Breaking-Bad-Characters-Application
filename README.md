## Breaking Bad-Characters Application


A   Breaking Bad-Characters I created for the sake of practicing React and context api . It features design 
patterns recommended by the documentation. Some of the tools used include: <br />

* Hooks (and custom hooks)
* React Router
* axios
* react-paginate
* react-router-dom


#The future of this project: <br />

* mange the data with context api 
* create two pages (Home , Details ) .
* use api to get data
